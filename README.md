# GameNetworkPlayground
I took a **computer networking course at university** and I was interested in it, and since I was already making multiplayer games, I started to dig deeper. I used services like **Photon and mirror**, but I was wondering how these things work from scratch, here I am learning network communication in unity **with my research on the internet and the videos I watch**. I will update this repo whenever I make something new.

DONE:
